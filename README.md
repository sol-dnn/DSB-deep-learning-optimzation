## Deep Learning & Optimization Labs: DSB Polytechnique Master's Course

This repository contains the code and notebooks for the labs completed during a Deep Learning and Optimization master's course at Polytechnique, taught by professors Aymeric Dieuleveut and A. Taylor. The repository is divided into two main folders:

## 1. Deep Learning

This folder contains labs on various topics related to deep learning, including:

Introduction to Neural Networks
Neural Network Architectures
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

## 2. Optimization

This folder contains labs on optimization techniques for machine learning, including:

Gradient Descent
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Advanced Optimization Techniques (Variants)

### Getting Started

The labs in this repository require Python and several libraries for deep learning and optimization. Refer to the individual lab notebooks for specific library requirements. We used Pytorch.
